<h1 class="w3-animate-top" id="heading">ABOUT ME</h1>
<p class="w3-animate-top" id="p1">I was born and brought up in Delhi and currently reside in Hyderabad. I have a small family consisting of my father, my mother, me and my younger sister. I believe in hardwork and the need to work efficiently. I was guided by my parents throughout my life which inculcated some good values in me. Determination and self-confidence are two of the most important keywords that I rely upon. </p>
<p  class="animate-left" id="p2">I studied in Manav Sthali School in New Delhi and have a deep relationship with it. I would always be thankful to all the teachers who taught me something at any point of my life.</p>
<p class="animate-right" id="p3">I am deeply inspired by quotes some of them being:</p>
<p id="p4"><i>"Work so silently that your Success shouts" - Frank Ocean</i></p>
<p id="p5"><i>"Quality is never an Accident, It is always a result of intelligent effort" - John Ruskin</i></p>
